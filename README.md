# devCoach - Virtual Coding Coach

## Overview

devCoach is a virtual coding coach designed to assist learners in their coding journey. As an interaction designer venturing into programming, I encountered challenges with outdated information from Chat GPT while developing my first project, a virtual travel assistant named Katelyn. This inspired me to create devCoach, leveraging a type of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to reference online documentation.

devCoach uses Streamlit for the user interface and integrates with OpenAI's powerful language models to provide personalized coding assistance. By combining retrieval-based search with generative responses, it offers tailored guidance based on user queries.

## Features

- Interactive interface for seamless user interaction
- Retrieval-based search across various document types
- Generative responses powered by OpenAI's language models
- Personalized guidance tailored to user queries
- Includes a fun test document where you can learn my dog's name is Momo

## Usage

To use devCoach, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the application by executing:
streamlit run devcoach.py

3. Access the application through your web browser and start asking coding-related questions.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit
- OpenAI's language models
- Python
- SQLite (for storing document data)
- Markdown, text, and HTML files (as sources for documentation)
